        <p>The purpose of this blog is to share a bit about my journey in the game development space, some of the hurdles I had to cross and my pivot towards a career in software development. Near the end I would like to end it on some cool VR stuff since this is where my true interests lie and is probably a bit more interesting to hear about than my personal life, but you can be the judge of that.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <p>I’ll start off by telling you a brief history of game development journey so far. I started by completing my Graphic Design degree just as Covid hit, which was a challenge to say the least. I made it more difficult for myself by reaching way outside of my comfort zone and doing my final year project around the VR industry. My project ended up being a showcase of a learning experience in Virtual Reality for students studying STEM subjects at GCSE level, in particular Chemistry. </p>

        <p>Without going to much into depth, to accomplish this project I had learn Blender, a 3D modelling program, Substance Painter, a procedural texturing program, animation, rigging, texturing and basically a basic understanding of game development in a very short amount of time. Now I can’t say I didn’t like the challenge, but boy was there a lot of work to be done. Nether the less I pursed and achieved a very desirable outcome.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <p>From there I got a small job at a small VR indie studio where I furthered my skills but ultimately never released anything since Covid had a big impact on the business’s financial situation and eventually had to shut down the project and company all together, which was unfortunate, but such is the way of life sometimes.</p>
